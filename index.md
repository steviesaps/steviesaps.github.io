## Welcome to my AWS re/Start GitHub Page

Welcome to my first AWS re/Start GitHub page.

This is a portfolio of my first foray in Python as part of the AWS re/Start course.

### Python

Below are some examples of the Python I have coded using the hands on labs during this course:

```markdown
#FunWIthStrings.py

first_str = "I love dogs"

second_Str = " and cats"

newstr = first_str + second_str

print(newStr)

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/steviesaps/steviesaps.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Support or Contact
